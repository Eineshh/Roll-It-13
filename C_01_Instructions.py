First off, you choose a scoring objective (e.g. The first player to score 50 points or more). 

Next, you roll a die to determine how many points you earn for each round. 

The player who comes closest to 13 wins the round. 

If you roll a double on your first roll, you obtain double the amount of points (6 X 2 = 12). If you win the round, 
your score will grow by the number you earned

You receive zero points if you lose the round. 

In a tie, the number of bonus points awarded to each player is the same.
